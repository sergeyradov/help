# Welcome to Flood IO

Getting started with Flood IO is easy! You can create a Flood right now on our shared Grid node, or scale out On Demand with your own Grid nodes. It's all up to you.

## New to Load Testing?

Make sure you read our [blog](https://flood.io/blog) for lots of detailed help and examples. We also answer some common questions in our [FAQ](https://flood.io/faq) . We have some template test plans for the different tool versions we support which will help you get started.

[Ruby-JMeter DSL](https://flood.io/ruby-jmeter.rb)

JMeter users can also try our [har2jmx online converter](https://flood.io/har2jmx) to create their first test plan.

## Where can I Load Test from?

You can use our shared Grid to shake out your flood test scenarios. This is a shared resource so you may need to wait for results.

Free accounts are limited to 5 minute tests. Upgrade your Account to skip the queue and create Floods on your own dedicated Grids in any of our nine supported regions.
