# Getting JMeter

JMeter can be downloaded [here](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) and typically you can start JMeter using the `jmeter.cmd` or `jmeter.sh` scripts located in the downloaded archive `bin` directory.

# Creating a Test Plan

Once you have created or downloaded our [basic test plan](https://flood.io/jmeter-example.jmx) and saved it locally as a `.jmx` file, you can upload this to Flood IO to create your first Flood test.

# Creating a Flood Test

After you login to Flood IO you can click the "+" icon or from your [Floods dashboard](/dashboard/floods) you can click the "Create Flood" button to create a new Flood.

In the new Flood form, add the `.jmx` test plan you created using JMeter to the Files input and select a Grid to run your Flood test on. You can optionally set the "Name" or "Tags" to help identify the test in your dashboard.
