## Shared Grid

If you've queued a test on the Shared Grid node and it hasn't reached the `running` status yet, there may be a long wait on this queue as this is shared infrastructure. If you wish to avoid the queue on the Shared Grid we recommend you start your own on Demand or Hosted Grid, available to our paid customers. Each account plan includes complimentary On Demand grid node hours. More details are on our [pricing page](/pricing).

## Paid Grids

If you're experiencing long queue waits on your own On Demand or Hosted Grid infrastructure and no other Flood tests are running, this may indicate a problem with the queue itself. A stop / start may clear the queue of any problem tests. Alternatively you can reboot Grid nodes if you think a test is hung or the Grid nodes have stopped responding.
