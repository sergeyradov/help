Grid nodes startup time average 5 - 10 minutes per node, depending on the region and availability of the instance size selected. When all grid nodes have started, the grid will change status to __Started__

Any grid nodes which fail to enter start after 20 minutes will be flagged with a __Problem__ status. You have the option of rebooting individual nodes in your grid which should resolve any intermittent issues.
