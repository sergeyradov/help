We monitor the average CPU, Memory and Disk utilization across each grid and report any occurrences of high utilization > 80% for a 5 minute average.

If your grid has reached these conditions we recommend investigating root cause. Common causes are poorly specified test plans (use of listeners) or particularly complex / large test plans (too many threads per grid node).

Your options are to scale out with more grid nodes.
